PDF Search and Listing

Life was easy when the Credit Card bill from the company was downloadble in CSV format. For some reason the company switched to PDF format which 
has been a bit boring for me to review the bill

This inspired me to write two python scrips: 

1. To review the Items Summary (non-repeated list of items) of each page, pdf_items_list.py
   Here the data is being splitted and shaped based on month input 
3. To search/dig further possible detail of suspected item(s) in the Summary, pdf_item_search.py
   Here the data is splitted based on month as well and item is another input to get the further info
 
A quick way to search and review PDF files in IDE, adopt as per your need
